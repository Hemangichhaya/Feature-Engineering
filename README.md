Recommendations
* The OSRM trip planning system needs to be improved. Discrepancies need to be catered to for transporters, if the routing engine is configured for optimum results.

* There exists a variance between osrm_time and actual_time. The team's objective is to minimize this differential, enhancing the accuracy of delivery time predictions for a more seamless customer experience.

* The osrm_distance and actual distance covered are also not same i.e. maybe the delivery person is not following the predefined route which may lead to late deliveries or the osrm devices is not properly predicting the route based on distance, traffic and other factors. Team needs to look into it.

* Most of the orders are coming from/reaching to states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana and Tamil Nadu. The existing corridors can be further enhanced to improve the penetration in these areas.

* Conducting customer profiling for Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh is essential to understand the driving factors behind the high order volume from these states. This analysis aims to enhance the overall purchasing and delivery experience for customers in these regions.

* Considering the specific states, it's crucial to acknowledge potential traffic congestion in some regions and challenging terrain conditions in others. This insight serves as a valuable indicator for strategizing and meeting demand, especially during peak festival seasons.
